/// Compress integer input so that higher resolution is preserved for
/// values near zero, while reducing systematic bias between input and
/// compressed output
///
/// The motivating use case is to reduce the total number of integers used for
/// a map key, where the integer represents count data, such that high resolution
/// should be preserved near zero
///
/// The compression scheme is: The highest "bitCount" bits from the input integer
/// are preserved, followed by a suffix. The suffix is fixed for all input with the
/// same prefix, and is set in such a way that systematic bias between the input
/// and compressed output is reduced.
///
/// This function deterministically switches between two suffix values, one
/// has only the high bit set, the other is the complement of the first. The suffix
/// is chosen based on the low bit of the prefix (or shift value if bitCount is one).
///
/// Example: For bitCount=3 and input=67:
///
/// input  is 67 or 0b1000011
/// output is 72 or 0b1001000
///
/// Here the top three bits are preserved "0b100XXXX", and the suffix "0bXXX1000" is
/// replaced on the lower bits to create the compressed output.
///
/// T must be of an unsigned integral type
///
