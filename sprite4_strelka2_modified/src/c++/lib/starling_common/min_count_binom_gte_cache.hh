/// \brief special caching variant of the min_count_binomial_gte_exact function
///
/// The min_count_binomial_gte_exact function returns the minimum number of
/// successes to reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of at most alpha
/// for a given error rate (p) and number of trials (n).
///
/// This object is a special caching variant of the min_count_binomial_gte_exact
/// function. For caching to be effective you must (1) supply a single value of
/// alpha beforehand and (2) The (n,p) range of your binomial calls should meet
/// Poisson approximation conditions. The optimized implementation takes advantage
/// of the Poisson approximation to the binomial to efficiently cache the 2D (n,p)
/// function space to a more compact 1D (n*p) space. Calls to (n,p) which fall outside
/// the range of Poisson approximation will be routed to the standard
/// min_count_binomial_gte_exact function, so results for this case will be accurate
/// but have unoptimized compute cost.
