/// Normalize alignment so that indels are left-shifted and simplified.
///
/// Indels are left-shifted in such a way that the match count of the alignment
/// does not get worse with each 1-base left-shift operation.
///
/// Multiple indels can potentially be left-shifted to become adjacent. If this
/// happens the indels will be merged into one larger indel.
///
/// Indels are 'simplified' by identifying any portion of a set of adjacent
/// insert/delete edits which can be matched to reference. For example:
/// REF: ACTGC, READ: ACGC, CIGAR: 2M1I2D1M
/// Should collapse to CIGAR: 2M1D2M
///
/// Indels at or left-shifted to the edge of an alignment are simplified if possible.
/// For indels on the left edge of the alignment this could change the alignment
/// position.
///
/// All hard and soft clipping at the alignment edge is preserved.
///
/// Note that any BAM CIGAR seq-match/mismatch states ("=","X") will be collapsed to
/// regular match ("M") states in regions surrounding normalized indels.
///
/// \returns True if the input alignment is changed
