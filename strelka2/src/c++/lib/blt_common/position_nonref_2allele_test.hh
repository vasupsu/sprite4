/// \brief Call a snp at a position under the assumption that up to
/// one nonref allele could occur at any frequency. When a snp is
/// found, optionally also provide the allele MLEs.
///
/// Method is optimized to pick up low-frequency snps, but will also
/// inevitably call higher frequency germline variation (without
/// correct priors) if present.
///
/// \param nonref_variant_rate The expected non-reference variant frequency (suggested start point: 0.000001)
/// \param min_nonref_freq The minimum non-reference allele frequency considered
/// \param nonref_site_error_rate The expected rate of erroneous non-reference allele sites applied to the nonref model. At error sites a nonref allele is expected in the frequency range [0,decay_freq], with a probability that linearly decays to zero at decay_freq. (suggested start point: 0.0001)
/// \param nonref_site_error_decay_freq The decay_freq used for the site-error state as described above. (suggested start point 0.01)
