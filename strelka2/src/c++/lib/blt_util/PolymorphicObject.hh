/// \brief Convenience base class for polymorphic objects

/// This class helps get around some of the boilerplate imposed by
/// c++11 spec implicit copy ctor rules for virtual classes. Use
/// this as a public base class for any standard virtual object with
/// default copy/move semantics.
///
/// Per suggestion on thread:
/// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19997646/no-implicit-copy-constructor-in-polymorphic-class

#if ((!defined(_MSC_VER)) || (_MSC_VER > 1800))
    // support moving
    PolymorphicObject(PolymorphicObject&&) = default;
    PolymorphicObject& operator=(PolymorphicObject&&) = default;
