/// \brief Search for a set of alternate alignments for each read, score them, and
///        select a 'best' alignment to use for SNV calling.
///
/// A single best alignment is created for SNV calling, but for indel calling we
/// use a pool of alternate alignments to capture the likelihood of the read supporting
/// or not supporting each allele.
///
/// Note search is for most likely realignment to a pool of potential
/// haplotypes formed by all possible candidate indel combinations. This
/// means there are not penalties for candidate indels if we think about the
/// realignment wrt the reference haplotype.
///
/// \param realign_buffer_range The range (in reference coordinates) in which the read is allowed to realign
///          (due to buffering constraints)
