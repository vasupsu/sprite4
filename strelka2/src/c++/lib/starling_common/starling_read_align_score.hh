/// The score is essentially `P(read | haplotype)`, where read=rseg and haplotype=ref+candidate alignment. This
/// is 'essentially' instead of 'exactly' because Strelka's haplotype model is not fully carried forward to
/// this point, so we have a collection of candidate indels and SNV positions rather than strict haplotype (set)
/// that the read is scored against. It is also an approximation because we're only considering a single alignment
/// of the read to the target haplotype.
